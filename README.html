**📜 1. Menu Initialization**
The menu is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a menu item.
Each item contains:
name: The name of the food item (e.g., "Mozzarella Sticks").
price: The price of the item (e.g., $6.99).
This data stores the items that the user can order.
**🖥️ 2. Clearing the Console**
The clear_console() function is designed to clear the console screen.
It checks the operating system (Windows or Unix-based) and then uses the appropriate command:
Windows: cls
Linux/macOS: clear
This helps in refreshing the interface to maintain a clean console view after every operation.
**📝 3. Displaying the Menu**
The show_menu() function iterates through the menu list and prints each menu item in a formatted way.
It shows each item’s index, name, and price on the console.
Each item in the console output is also separated with a line ("-" * 30) for better readability.
**🔄 4. Main Ordering Loop**
The loop runs continuously until the user chooses to finish the ordering process by entering the number 11.
Key Steps in the Loop:
User Input:

The input() function asks the user to enter a number representing the item they want to order.
This input is then converted into an integer.
Check if User Wants to Finish:

If the user enters 11, the loop terminates, meaning the user is done ordering.
Order Processing:

The code checks whether the entered number corresponds to a valid menu item (i.e., within the range of available indices).
If valid:
It adds the price of the item to the total price.
It adds the name of the item to the order_list for tracking the ordered items.
Invalid Input Handling:

If the user inputs a number outside the available menu range or an invalid value, it prints an error message and prompts the user to enter a correct item number.
Screen Refresh:

After each order, it refreshes the console screen using the clear_console() method.
It then redisplays the updated menu with any new selections made.
**📝 5. Order Summary**
Once the loop ends, the console clears again to show a summary of ordered items.
The order_list contains the names of the selected items.
The prc variable stores the total cost of the orders.
Finally, it displays each item in the order_list and prints the total price.
🔍 Key Concepts
Data Storage:

The menu is stored as a list of dictionaries, which makes it easy to access items by their index.
User Interaction:

The code uses loops and input validation to interact with the user through the console interface.
It ensures a user-friendly experience by refreshing the console screen after each order.
Error Handling:

The try-except block is implemented to handle invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring that the user can only interact with numeric values.
✅ Overall Functionality
This console-based system enables a restaurant ordering workflow where a user:

Views available menu options.
Selects desired items by entering corresponding numbers.
Adds prices automatically and gets a clear breakdown of the order summary with a total cost.
